ack Reacher is a figure of almost zen-like calm—or he would be, if he ever stopped breaking people’s limbs so cavalierly. As played by Tom Cruise, the ex-military cop is somehow short and gigantic all at once, an oblong hulk who hitchhikes from town to town dispensing justice. The first entry in the Jack Reacher film series—based on a series of books by Lee Child—was a brutish delight, a grim potboiler that seemed conjured from an earlier era of Hollywood. But its new sequel, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, is dispiritingly formulaic, retaining much of the first film’s swaggering masculinity, but none of its self-awareness.

What Mission: Impossible Understands About Tom Cruise

It’s too bad, because the Jack Reacher series has given Cruise a perfect avatar for this late, strange, action-hero era in his career. Devoid of the boyish charm that propelled the actor to stardom in the ’80s and ’90s, Reacher is a vengeful alien walking among foolish mortals, a detached, but nonetheless oddly compelling ex-soldier who barks lines like, “I mean to beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot.” Cruise is terrific in Never Go Back, seeming more comfortable than ever as a man who struggles to personally relate to anyone unless he’s trying to snap their neck, but the film doesn’t come close to matching his bizarre intensity.

Directed by Edward Zwick (who worked with Cruise on The Last Samurai and is slumming from his usual prestige-picture territory), Never Go Back is adapted from the 18th book in Child’s never-ending series, and this choice of source material has its flaws. The film assumes an easy familiarity with its character that many viewers may not have, as Reacher navigates the world of the U.S. Military Police, of which he is a former member, and uncovers a gun-running conspiracy.
